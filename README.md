This was a project where I needed to create a quiz with a timer attached to it. 

It will allow the user to click through buttons to try and select the correct responses. You will be penalized 3 seconds off of your 30 second timer if you do not answer a question correctly. 

After answering all questions, the website will allow you to record your score and show you in a leaderboard alongside other participants. 

I had a very hard time with this. I am still behind, but I am catching up piece by piece. I definitley will be purchasing some kind of physical reference book to help me supplant the information given in this class. Putting everything together is still a bit hard for me from scratch.
